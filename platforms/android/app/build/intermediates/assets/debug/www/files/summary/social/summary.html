				<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;" ng-show="shigh">Your
					scores on this aspect of wellbeing fall on the higher side as
					compared to many others. This suggests that by and large you tend
					to hold positive attitudes towards people in general and feel a
					sense of belongingness with the society. You may also believe that
					society has a potential of improving and that you can contribute in
					some way or another to the society.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;" ng-show="saverage">Your
					scores on this aspect of wellbeing fall in the average range and
					your experience of social well being is similar to many others. You
					are likely to be accepting of people and feel connected to the
					society to some extent. You may in addition feel that there is a
					scope of improvement in society to an extent and experience that
					you are contributing to others in some way. However, you may not
					find yourself to be high on all these aspects of social well-being.
					Social wellbeing is a somewhat neglected aspect of well being but
					it is linked to leading a productive and harmonious life, marked by
					doing one’s best to shape one’s environment.</p>
				<p style="font-size: 18px; text-align: justify;" ng-show="slow">Your
					scores on this aspect of wellbeing fall in the lower range as
					compared to several others. The low scores on this measure may come
					about from having had experiences that decrease your sense of trust
					in others, give rise to a sense of not-belonging, being
					marginalized or not well accepted by others. It could also come
					from a state wherein you feel pessimistic about societal
					development and about your own potential contribution to others’
					life. This state of low social wellbeing could be related to one or
					more of the following factors: living in a highly
					challenging/difficult social environment with low stability, low
					emotional and psychological well being, high distress, or a pattern
					of life choices focused mostly on one’s own self. You may not find
					yourself to be low on one or more aspects of social well-being as
					mentioned above. Social wellbeing is a somewhat neglected aspect of
					well being but it is linked to leading a productive and harmonious
					life, marked by doing one’s best to shape one’s environment. It
					would help to think about the factors that relate to your low
					social well being and reflecting on what you could do to enhance
					this aspect of well being.</p>
