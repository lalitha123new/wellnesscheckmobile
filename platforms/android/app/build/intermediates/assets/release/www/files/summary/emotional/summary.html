					Negative emotions are also an important aspect of measuring well
					being, since its higher frequency indicates lower emotional well
					being. These emotions can take various forms such as irritation,
					anger, nervousness, guilt, sadness etc.<br>Your scores for
					negative emotions fall on the higher side, which means that in the
					last few weeks, you have experienced negative emotions more often
					than most other people. This might be either due to a particularly
					difficult phase, or it might reflect a long term need for emotion
					management skills.<br>Repeating this assessment over time may
					give a clearer idea if this is a longer term pattern.<br>
					Negative emotions are inevitable part of life and even serve a
					useful purpose in some ways in many contexts. For example, an
					optimum amount of anxiety pushes us to get prepared for dealing
					with a challenge/threat, sadness may help us reflect/introspect on
					what is going wrong and anger may provide the push to stand up and
					deal with injustice/unfairness. However, when these emotions are
					too frequently experienced or expressed in an
					in-appropriated/uncontrolled fashion, these become a source of
					distress and also result in other negative consequences on oneself
					and others.<br>The frequency of experience of such emotions,
					their intensity and the length of time for which these last (slow
					vs. faster recovery from negative emotional states) can be altered
					through shifts in one’s mental approach and regular practices that
					help manage such emotions effectively. Look up the resource-
					section for a few such tips.
